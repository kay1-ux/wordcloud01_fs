This was very much against the advise of the IT department at the time which recommended to separate the computer from the ceramics dust. Keeping the computer in the room levelled the preciousness of the computer which was expensive at the time and made it a tool of the studio like any other. This was pivotal and would later be articulated as a desire to combine technologies as an essential Tennant of contemporary craft practice."},

I got into this field because I love the pure process of [the craft] and I just don't want to spend hours of time sitting at my computer looking at tutorials learning about new software. By the time I might actually gain some proficiency in something, the world will be onto something new and shiny, and all my knowledge will be obsolete. If I wanted computers to mediate my creative process, I think I would have chosen a different career path."},

I found no matter how carefully I sawed and filed my material, I could not achieve the tight tolerances I needed. This was the moment when I knew that digital process would be necessary to supplement my hand skills."},

On the other hand, existing faculty have limited time to learn. We have a excellent access to professional development funds and some time (1 month a year), but because we're not a research university, this is often the only time faculty have for their own artistic practice."},

With the limited amount of time students have, this can be a real barrier to them incorporating these tools into their practices. There is also a massive training gap, not just for artists but everyone working with digital fabrication: we now have amazing technology, but it is still so new that almost no one has formal training. So from an organizational stand point, this is going to require a substantial investment of resources in training over the long term to increase and cement the usage of digital tools in Arts Education."},

The stuff is just begging to be played with and manipulated. The challenge is, how can that approach/interaction be grafted onto digital platforms, in the sense that the interaction with the material and process is so immersive that it gives way to wandering, and happy accidents, and discovery? This can somewhat be found in the way a design course is laid out - A design project that moves between traditional analogue materials and processes and digital fabrication generates an understanding of emerging platforms, opens critique for our manufacturing paradigm, and most importantly motivates students to develop a personal expression through these often intimidating technologies."},

I am concerned about disembodied experiences. I think we need to be continuously mindful of this need for the judicious integration of hand and technology.  One need not and should not eclipse the other and we should not privilege one over the other as both have important roles to play in society. We can never know (present circumstances being an example) when each will be needed to help us survive."},
